# REST-API-for-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Flask-and-Pandas
Develop a REST API using Flask to upload and process CSV files. The API will allow users to upload data, perform data analysis (like summarizing statistics, filtering data, etc.), and then return the processed data in both JSON format and a visual format (graphical charts).
